Average delay: 1143.687 with variance 623217.68. Messages which employ mules have an average delay of 1158.586 with variance 620068.798 
14250 out of 137744 messages come from border nodes. For these messages the average delay is 1391.868, against 692.306 of the non-border nodes
Average number of hops = 13.817433 On average delay for not immediate messages (21801 out of 137744 messages) is composed of 188.002982 as a bus-mule delay, 553.259942 as a proxy-mule delay, 417.322737 as delay3
